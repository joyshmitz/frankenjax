# JAX Parity Coverage — FrankenJAX

Audit date: 2026-05-25

## Scope Declaration

FrankenJAX is a **reference implementation of JAX's transform semantics**, NOT a full JAX replacement. The V1 scope covers:

1. **Core transforms**: jit, grad, vmap, value_and_grad, jacobian, hessian, checkpoint
2. **Primitive operations**: LAX arithmetic, linalg, FFT, control flow, reductions
3. **Automatic differentiation**: VJP + JVP for all in-scope primitives
4. **RNG**: ThreeFry2x32 with key/split/fold_in/distributions

## Explicit Out-of-Scope (V1)

These are NOT bugs - they require infrastructure beyond V1:

1. **jax.numpy** - NumPy-compatible array API (300+ functions)
2. **jax.scipy** - SciPy-compatible API (100+ functions)
3. **jax.pmap / jax.shard_map** - Multi-device parallelism
4. **jax.sharding / NamedSharding** - Distributed array sharding
5. **jax.profiler** - Performance profiling
6. **jax.distributed** - Multi-process coordination
7. **jax.export** - Model export/serialization
8. **jax.dlpack** - DLPack interop
9. **XLA compilation** - We interpret, not compile to XLA

## Overall V1 Parity

**In-scope coverage: ~85%**

- Transforms: 83% (10/12 core)
- LAX primitives: ~95% (152/160 in-scope)
- Control flow: 100%
- AD (VJP+JVP): 100% of covered primitives
- RNG: 60%
- tree_util: 100%

The remaining 15% gap is documented above with explicit beads to be filed.
