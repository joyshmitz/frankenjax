# Negative Evidence Ledger

Canonical project ledger: `../evidence/perf/negative_evidence_ledger.md`.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-xljoh compiled-dispatch f64 mid-cache keep

`frankenjax-xljoh` shipped only the measured narrow fallback: reusable
`CompiledJaxprRunner` routes one-tensor f64 linear chains in the
65,536..=262,144 element band through owned compiled eval. It did not ship a
broad f32 route or an upper-band f64 route.

Directional candidate Rust/JAX ratios from the new comparator artifact
`../artifacts/performance/evidence/frankenjax-xljoh-jax-comparator-20260620T0550Z.json`:

| Row | Rust/JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| f64 4K x8 | 0.541 | Rust faster; guard off |
| f64 65K x8 | 1.516 | JAX faster; kept internal mid-cache fallback |
| f64 262K x8 | 3.195 | JAX faster; remaining gap |
| f64 1M x8 | 20.36 | JAX faster; fallback correctly off |
| f64 16M x8 | 4.55 | JAX faster; no safe win in this lever |
| f32 4K x8 | 0.163 | Rust faster; no f32 route |
| f32 65K x8 | 0.637 | Rust faster; no f32 route |

Retry predicate: do not reattempt broad f32 routing or f64 fallback expansion
without same-host or same-worker proof. The remaining f64 large-chain loss needs
deeper output reuse, vector codegen, or backend specialization.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-q59j4/co009 LiteralBuffer internal keeps

`frankenjax-q59j4` and `frankenjax-co009` were closed as measured internal
keeps after RCH validation. These rows do not claim a JAX-vs-Rust win because
they cover host-internal `LiteralBuffer` mutation and conformance/fixture
serialization paths with no direct JAX API-equivalent comparator.

Validation used `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenjax-cod-b`.
The Criterion pass ran on RCH worker `vmi1149989`; `fj-conformance` ran on
`hz2` and passed 45 tests, 0 failed.

| Row | Dense Rust | Literal control | Ratio | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `literal_buffer_index_mut_f64_64k` | 24.003 us | 33.278 us | 0.721 | Keep: 1.39x faster internally; JAX N/A |
| `literal_buffer_serialize_f64_64k` | 1.3443 ms | 1.6493 ms | 0.815 | Keep: 1.23x faster internally; JAX N/A |

Decision: keep both committed direct paths. They reduce internal ledger,
fixture, and mutation overhead; the next JAX-facing work remains output/arena
reuse, non-temporal stores/prefetch/NUMA, or a specific typed-path external
loss with same-host proof.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-oneqh allocator default no-ship

`frankenjax-oneqh` was closed as an evidence-only no-ship. The proposed default
allocator change was not committed, and `CHEAP_BINARY_PARALLEL_MIN` was not
retuned or removed.

Local same-host allocator preload verification used
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenjax-cod-b-local-20260620`
with `fj-lax` `elementwise_gauntlet`. JAX used 0.10.1 CPU x64 via
`benchmarks/jax_comparison/.venv/bin/python`. Jemalloc was available at
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.2`; mimalloc was not installed.

| Row | glibc Rust | jemalloc Rust | JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `add_f64_16m/dense` | 24.502 ms, Rust/JAX 0.870 | 33.095 ms, Rust/JAX 1.174 | 28.179 ms | Reject: allocator preload regresses |
| `add_f32_16m/dense` | 15.945 ms, Rust/JAX 1.128 | 16.784 ms, Rust/JAX 1.188 | 14.130 ms | Reject/neutral: no allocator win |
| `mul_f64_16m/dense` | 29.210 ms, Rust/JAX 1.024 | 27.790 ms, Rust/JAX 0.974 | 28.525 ms | Neutral/slight win only |

Decision: no production allocator change. The next credible levers are
compiled-jaxpr output/arena reuse, non-temporal stores/prefetch/NUMA work, or a
specific unowned typed-path gap with same-host proof.
