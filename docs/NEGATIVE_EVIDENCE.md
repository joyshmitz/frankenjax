## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-murmw radix-4 power-of-four FFT no-ship

The BOLD-VERIFY pass retargeted the current FFT losses after the earlier
mixed-radix and plan-cache keeps. HEAD still loses hard to warmed JAX CPU on
the full `fj-lax` eval path, but the attempted safe radix-4 plan was reverted:
it won a narrow same-binary inner-kernel A/B and lost the full end-to-end gate.

Fresh baseline on RCH worker `vmi1153651` with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenjax-cod-b`:

| Row | HEAD Rust | JAX mean | Rust/JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `fft_1000_complex128` | 70.525 us | 31.204 us | 2.260 | Existing loss |
| `fft_1009_prime_complex128` | 243.86 us | 63.710 us | 3.828 | Existing loss |
| `fft_batch_128x1000_complex128` | 5.9966 ms | 197.438 us | 30.372 | Existing loss |
| `fft_batch_2048x256_complex128` | 30.983 ms | 284.224 us | 109.01 | Existing loss |
| `fft_batch_2048x256_complex128_dense_input` | 13.033 ms | 284.224 us | 45.85 | Existing loss |

Rejected lever: a safe recursive `Radix4Plan` for power-of-four lengths
matched DFT/IDFT tolerance and measured 2.13x faster than `Radix2Plan` in a
same-binary inner-kernel A/B on RCH worker `hz2` (`80.976 ms -> 38.024 ms` for
2048 rows of length 256). The full eval path on the same baseline worker
regressed: boxed batched FFT `30.983 ms -> 42.532 ms`; dense-input batched FFT
`13.033 ms -> 33.199 ms`. Source was reverted before commit.

Ratio scorecard for this pass: 0 wins / 7 losses / 0 neutral vs JAX. Production
decision: no source change. Retry only with an iterative in-place radix-4/8,
SoA/SIMD, or cache-blocked batched kernel that proves an end-to-end win; do not
retry naive recursive radix-4 routing from an inner-kernel microbench alone.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-mcqr f64->u32 packed bitcast keep, u32->f64 revert

The BOLD-VERIFY pass targeted the remaining `f64<->u32` width-changing bitcast
losses after the earlier half-width presized-fill keep. The kept lever replaces
the dense `f64 -> u32` byte-array/push materializer with a presized packed
little-endian low/high `u32` fill and a scoped threaded path for 1M+ source
lanes. The attempted symmetric `u32 -> f64` presized/threaded path regressed and
was reverted before commit.

Same-worker Rust proof on RCH worker `hz1` with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenjax-cod-a`:

| Row | Baseline Rust | Candidate Rust | Internal delta | JAX mean | Candidate/JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `bitcast_f64_u32_dense_1m` | 1.5904 ms | 1.1781 ms | 1.35x faster | 163.747 us | 7.195 | Keep internally; still JAX loss |
| `bitcast_f64_u32_literal_ref_1m` | 74.361 ms | 69.507 ms | 1.07x faster | 163.747 us | 424.48 | Control improved, still JAX loss |
| `bitcast_u32_f64_dense_1m` rejected candidate | 989.96 us | 1.2378 ms | 1.25x slower midpoint; Criterion +28.5% | 123.933 us | 9.988 | Revert |
| `bitcast_u32_f64_literal_ref_1m` rejected candidate | 51.321 ms | 49.209 ms | Neutral/no keep | 123.933 us | 397.06 | No production claim |

JAX timing used local CPU JAX/JAXLIB 0.10.1 via
`benchmarks/jax_comparison/bitcast_gauntlet.py --runs 20 --warmup 5
--inner-loops 200`. JAX CV was high (`f64->u32` 34.45%, `u32->f64` 31.97%),
so Rust/JAX ratios are routing evidence; the keep decision uses the same-worker
Rust delta. Ratio scorecard for the measured `f64/u32` rowset: 0 JAX wins / 4
losses / 0 neutral. Production delta after revert: 1 internal win / 0 shipped
regressions, with `u32->f64` unchanged and still a JAX loss.

Validation: `cargo test -p fj-lax bitcast --lib` passed 4/4; `cargo test -p
fj-conformance --test bitcast_oracle` passed 36/36; full `cargo test -p
fj-conformance` passed; `cargo check -p fj-lax --benches` passed; production
`cargo clippy -p fj-lax --lib -- -D warnings` passed. `cargo fmt --check -p
fj-lax` remains red on pre-existing unrelated formatting drift and did not show
a diff in the new packed-bitcast hunk.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-xjbvr unary-chain fusion keep, JAX gap remains

The BOLD-VERIFY pass targeted `fj-interpreters` compiled-dispatch chains where
`Floor`, `Round`, and `Sign` broke dense cheap-op fusion. The kept lever extends
`CheapOp` to strict unary float ops and `i64 sign`, so `add -> unary -> add`
chains stay in the dense fused runner instead of falling back to per-equation
evaluation. `Ceil` and `Trunc` were included in the same semantic family and
covered by the focused parity test.

Same-worker internal rerun on RCH worker `hz1` with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenjax-cod-a`:

| Row | Baseline Rust | Candidate Rust | Internal delta | JAX mean | Candidate/JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `floor_f64_1m_add_unary_chain/n=4` | 21.229 ms | 2.5597 ms | 8.29x faster | 199.892 us | 12.805 | Keep internally; still JAX loss |
| `round_f64_1m_add_unary_chain/n=4` | 20.516 ms | 1.8803 ms | 10.91x faster | 186.162 us | 10.100 | Keep internally; still JAX loss |
| `sign_f64_1m_add_unary_chain/n=4` | 10.955 ms | 2.7290 ms | 4.01x faster | 342.029 us | 7.979 | Keep internally; still JAX loss |
| `floor_f32_1m_add_unary_chain/n=4` | 8.8956 ms | 8.0347 ms | 1.11x faster | 103.966 us | 77.282 | Marginal internal win; still severe JAX loss |
| `round_f32_1m_add_unary_chain/n=4` | 16.423 ms | 4.6730 ms | 3.51x faster | 123.124 us | 37.954 | Keep internally; still severe JAX loss |
| `sign_f32_1m_add_unary_chain/n=4` | 11.639 ms | 5.5279 ms | 2.11x faster | 128.710 us | 42.948 | Keep internally; still severe JAX loss |

The JAX comparator artifact is
`artifacts/performance/evidence/frankenjax-xjbvr-jax-unary-chain-20260620T1358Z.json`
using local CPU JAX 0.10.1. JAX CV was 10-16%, so the Rust/JAX rows are routing
evidence, but the same-worker Rust deltas are large enough to keep the fusion
change. Ratio scorecard for this pass: 0 wins / 6 losses / 0 neutral vs JAX.

Validation: focused `fj-interpreters` parity test passed; `cargo check -p
fj-interpreters --benches`, `cargo clippy -p fj-interpreters --benches -- -D
warnings`, targeted `nextafter_oracle` and `polygamma_oracle`, and full `cargo
test -p fj-conformance` all passed through RCH. Retry only with a deeper
codegen/output-reuse route for f32 unary widening and XLA-style fused kernels;
do not reattempt scalar per-equation dispatch shaving for these rows.

## 2026-06-20 - cod-b width-changing bitcast presized-fill keep

The BOLD-VERIFY pass targeted current scorecard losses rather than another
blocked FMA-policy retry. The kept lever presizes dense width-changing bitcast
outputs and fills by index for `f32 -> bf16/f16 chunks` and `bf16/f16 chunks ->
f32`, preserving the same little-endian chunk order and shape rules.

Same-worker RCH proof on `vmi1227854`:

| Row | Baseline Rust | Candidate Rust | JAX mean | Candidate/JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `bitcast_f32_bf16_1m` | 978.58 us | 125.40 us | 140.512 us | 0.892 | Keep: 7.80x internal win; Rust 1.12x faster than JAX |
| `bitcast_bf16_f32_1m` | 533.82 us | 123.49 us | 151.382 us | 0.816 | Keep: 4.32x internal win; Rust 1.23x faster than JAX |

Controls: literal-reference rows remained orders of magnitude slower
(`38.853 ms` and `27.965 ms` in the candidate run). JAX timing used
`benchmarks/jax_comparison/bitcast_gauntlet.py` with JAX 0.10.1 CPU x64,
20 runs, 5 warmups, and 200 inner loops. A local same-target Rust bench attempt
was rejected as invalid before measurement because the shared RCH target dir
contained artifacts built by a different nightly; the accepted Rust timing is
same-worker RCH baseline/candidate, conservatively compared with local JAX.

Validation: `cargo test -p fj-lax bitcast --lib` passed 4/4 on RCH
`vmi1293453`; `cargo test -p fj-conformance --test bitcast_oracle` passed
36/36 on RCH `hz2`; `cargo check -p fj-lax --all-targets` passed on RCH `hz1`;
production `cargo clippy -p fj-lax --lib -- -D warnings` passed on RCH
`vmi1149989`. Repo-wide `cargo fmt --check` and `fj-lax --all-targets` clippy
are blocked by pre-existing unrelated formatting/test lint debt; follow-up
`frankenjax-98eoz` tracks the clippy side.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-ligu5 vmap gather dense-float no-ship

`frankenjax-ligu5` was reopened against the dispatch-layer batched gather/scatter
de-box vein. Prior passes had already shipped direct I64 batched-operand gather
and lazy rank-1 overwrite scatter, so this pass added f64/f32 batched-operand
gather benchmark rows and measured them before touching production code.

RCH Rust timing used `fj-dispatch` on worker `vmi1152480` with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenjax-cod-a`. JAX timing used
the local CPU `jax.jit(vmap(take))` comparator in
`artifacts/performance/evidence/frankenjax-ligu5-jax-vmap-gather-20260620T1325Z.json`.

| Row | Rust midpoint | JAX mean | Rust/JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| I64 batched operand + batched indices | 8.6722 us | 31.266 us | 0.277 | Rust 3.61x faster |
| F64 batched operand + batched indices | 25.251 us | 33.224 us | 0.760 | Rust 1.32x faster |
| F32 batched operand + batched indices | 27.257 us | 31.369 us | 0.869 | Rust 1.15x faster |

Decision: keep the new benchmark coverage, but ship no production gather/scatter
change. JAX CV was high (17-25%), so these are routing rows rather than
certification-grade ratios; they are still enough to reject the suspected
dense-float batched gather JAX loss. Retry only with a fresh profile showing a
non-dense, higher-rank, partial-slice, or different dtype subcase.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-n75xr f64 scalar-add SIMD medium-band keep

`frankenjax-n75xr` kept a narrow exact-pattern `std::simd` specialization for
f64 `tensor + scalar + ...` compiled-dispatch chains only in the medium band
`1,048,576 <= n < FUSION_THREAD_MIN_ELEMS`. It preserves the scalar-add order per
lane and rejects operand-reversed first adds so edge-case bit semantics remain on
the generic fusion path.

Same-worker RCH proof on `vmi1227854`:

| Row | Baseline Rust | Candidate Rust | JAX mean | Candidate/JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| f64 1M x8 | 1.3412 ms | 821.23 us | 83.299 us | 9.859 | Keep: 1.63x internal win, still JAX loss |
| f64 16M x8, ungated branch | 78.933 ms | 104.63 ms | 27.610 ms | 3.790 | Reject: +32.56% regression, gated off before commit |

Small rows were not claimed: 65K and 262K are outside the kept gate and remain
JAX losses. Follow-up reruns after the final gate landed on `ovh-a`; `RCH_WORKER`
did not pin back to `vmi1227854`, so those rows are non-comparable worker noise.
Ratio scorecard after the kept gate: 0 wins / 4 losses / 0 neutral vs JAX for
the f64 large-chain production row set.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-cntiy FMA primitive policy no-ship

`frankenjax-cntiy` tested the direct ternary FMA primitive row that the softmax
`+fma` probe could not isolate. The benchmark harness now records `fma_f64_1m`
and `fma_f32_1m` with dense and boxed controls, but no production compiler flag
or target-feature policy was shipped.

JAX comparator caveat: JAX 0.10.1 in the local oracle environment does not
expose a public `jax.lax.fma`, so the comparator is warmed
`jax.jit(lambda a, b, c: a * b + c)`.

| Probe | Rust mean | JAX mean | Rust/JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| default dense `fma_f64_1m` | 2.6124 ms | 273.448 us | 9.553 | Loss: JAX 9.55x faster |
| default dense `fma_f32_1m` | 2.7622 ms | 111.281 us | 24.822 | Loss: JAX 24.82x faster |
| local `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+fma"` f64 | 925.02 us | 273.448 us | 3.383 | Improved but still JAX loss; no policy ship |
| local `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+fma"` f32 | 207.98 us | 111.281 us | 1.869 | Improved but still JAX loss; no policy ship |

RCH build guard passed for `cargo build --release -p fj-lax --benches` on
`vmi1227854`. RCH timing on `hz1` showed the dense primitive path is still a
real internal de-box win over boxed controls: f64 3.5198 ms vs 29.267 ms
(8.31x), f32 3.7757 ms vs 30.825 ms (8.16x). Local same-host default rows were
2.6124 ms vs 24.592 ms boxed (9.41x) and 2.7622 ms vs 26.151 ms boxed (9.47x).

Decision: keep the benchmark coverage, but do not ship a global `+fma` policy.
Ratio scorecard: 0 wins / 4 losses / 0 neutral vs JAX. Retry only with a
semantics-approved per-kernel target feature, generated/vectorized code path, or
output-reuse strategy that can be tested against this row directly.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-xljoh.1 f64 large-chain register/tile no-ships

`frankenjax-xljoh.1` tested two deeper f64 compiled-dispatch levers against
the remaining large-chain JAX losses. Both were reverted before commit.

Baseline on RCH worker `vmi1227854` for the unchanged runner:
65K 46.896 us, 262K 214.91 us, 1M 1.3315 ms, 16M 116.11 ms.
JAX comparator means are from the existing
`../artifacts/performance/evidence/frankenjax-xljoh-jax-comparator-20260620T0550Z.json`.

| Probe | Worker | Best relevant rows | Rust/JAX | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| ordered register pass for 8 scalar adds | `vmi1153651` | 65K 52.746 us; 1M 3.5382 ms; 16M 142.56 ms | 1.55 / 42.48 / 5.16 | Reject: failed to vectorize; worse than existing runner and still JAX loss |
| `FUSION_CHUNK` 8K -> 64K | `vmi1149989` | 65K 52.828 us; 1M 1.9764 ms; 16M 128.78 ms | 1.55 / 23.73 / 4.66 | Reject: Criterion reported regressions (+7.33%, +21.35%, +4.66%) |

Retry predicate: do not retry per-element register scalar-add fusion or larger
fusion tiles without disassembly/profile evidence showing SIMD vectorization and
a same-worker before/after win. The remaining f64 chain gap is not a simple
chunk-size or step-order loop issue.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-cntiy softmax +fma/devirtualization no-ship

`frankenjax-cntiy` remains maintainer-gated, but this pass rejects two narrower
agent-actionable interpretations of the gate.

Same-host JAX oracle: `softmax_2d_65536x16` mean 1.0524 ms, p50 1.0765 ms,
CV 9.39%. Local Rust Criterion used
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenjax-cod-b-local-20260620`;
RCH validation used `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenjax-cod-b`.

| Probe | Rust mean | Rust/JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| default `nn/softmax_2d_65536x16_fused` | 2.2163 ms | 2.106 | Loss: JAX 2.11x faster |
| local `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+fma"` | 2.2096 ms | 2.100 | Neutral as a lever; still JAX loss |
| generic row-call devirtualization patch | 2.3303 ms | 2.214 | Regression; reverted |

RCH `cargo test -p fj-lax softmax_2d --lib` passed 10/0. An initial RCH
default-vs-`+fma` row on `vmi1149989` looked like a 4.7x `+fma` win, but a
rerun default row on `vmi1152480` and the same-host run both measured ~2.2 ms,
so that first default row is recorded only as an anomaly.

Decision: no source or build-policy win shipped. Global `+fma` alone does not
create the missing SIMD/fast-exp softmax kernel. Ratio scorecard: 0 wins / 3
losses / 0 neutral vs JAX.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-xljoh compiled-dispatch f64 mid-cache keep

`frankenjax-xljoh` shipped only the measured narrow fallback: reusable
`CompiledJaxprRunner` routes one-tensor f64 linear chains in the
65,536..=262,144 element band through owned compiled eval. It did not ship a
broad f32 route or an upper-band f64 route.

Directional candidate Rust/JAX ratios from the new comparator artifact
`../artifacts/performance/evidence/frankenjax-xljoh-jax-comparator-20260620T0550Z.json`:

| Row | Rust/JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| f64 4K x8 | 0.541 | Rust faster; guard off |
| f64 65K x8 | 1.516 | JAX faster; kept internal mid-cache fallback |
| f64 262K x8 | 3.195 | JAX faster; remaining gap |
| f64 1M x8 | 20.36 | JAX faster; fallback correctly off |
| f64 16M x8 | 4.55 | JAX faster; no safe win in this lever |
| f32 4K x8 | 0.163 | Rust faster; no f32 route |
| f32 65K x8 | 0.637 | Rust faster; no f32 route |

Retry predicate: do not reattempt broad f32 routing or f64 fallback expansion
without same-host or same-worker proof. The remaining f64 large-chain loss needs
deeper output reuse, vector codegen, or backend specialization.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-q59j4/co009 LiteralBuffer internal keeps

`frankenjax-q59j4` and `frankenjax-co009` were closed as measured internal
keeps after RCH validation. These rows do not claim a JAX-vs-Rust win because
they cover host-internal `LiteralBuffer` mutation and conformance/fixture
serialization paths with no direct JAX API-equivalent comparator.

Validation used `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenjax-cod-b`.
The Criterion pass ran on RCH worker `vmi1149989`; `fj-conformance` ran on
`hz2` and passed 45 tests, 0 failed.

| Row | Dense Rust | Literal control | Ratio | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `literal_buffer_index_mut_f64_64k` | 24.003 us | 33.278 us | 0.721 | Keep: 1.39x faster internally; JAX N/A |
| `literal_buffer_serialize_f64_64k` | 1.3443 ms | 1.6493 ms | 0.815 | Keep: 1.23x faster internally; JAX N/A |

Decision: keep both committed direct paths. They reduce internal ledger,
fixture, and mutation overhead; the next JAX-facing work remains output/arena
reuse, non-temporal stores/prefetch/NUMA, or a specific typed-path external
loss with same-host proof.

## 2026-06-20 - frankenjax-oneqh allocator default no-ship

`frankenjax-oneqh` was closed as an evidence-only no-ship. The proposed default
allocator change was not committed, and `CHEAP_BINARY_PARALLEL_MIN` was not
retuned or removed.

Local same-host allocator preload verification used
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenjax-cod-b-local-20260620`
with `fj-lax` `elementwise_gauntlet`. JAX used 0.10.1 CPU x64 via
`benchmarks/jax_comparison/.venv/bin/python`. Jemalloc was available at
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.2`; mimalloc was not installed.

| Row | glibc Rust | jemalloc Rust | JAX | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `add_f64_16m/dense` | 24.502 ms, Rust/JAX 0.870 | 33.095 ms, Rust/JAX 1.174 | 28.179 ms | Reject: allocator preload regresses |
| `add_f32_16m/dense` | 15.945 ms, Rust/JAX 1.128 | 16.784 ms, Rust/JAX 1.188 | 14.130 ms | Reject/neutral: no allocator win |
| `mul_f64_16m/dense` | 29.210 ms, Rust/JAX 1.024 | 27.790 ms, Rust/JAX 0.974 | 28.525 ms | Neutral/slight win only |

Decision: no production allocator change. The next credible levers are
compiled-jaxpr output/arena reuse, non-temporal stores/prefetch/NUMA work, or a
specific unowned typed-path gap with same-host proof.
