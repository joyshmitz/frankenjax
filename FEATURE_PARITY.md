## Required Evidence Per Family

1. Differential conformance report.
2. Invariant checklist entry/update.
3. Benchmark delta report for perf-sensitive changes.
4. Risk note update if compatibility/security surface changed.

## Coverage Objective

Target: 100% coverage for declared V1 scope, with explicit parity exceptions documented by artifact and linked to open bead IDs.
