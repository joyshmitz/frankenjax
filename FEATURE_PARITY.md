## Performance Evidence Updates

### 2026-05-01: Global performance gate (`frankenjax-fcxy.5`)

- Scope: phase-level performance evidence for trace, compile/dispatch, execute, cold-cache, warm-cache, and memory coverage.
- Baseline: `artifacts/performance/benchmark_baselines_v2_2026-03-12.json` records 82 Criterion benchmarks across dispatch, LAX evaluation, cache, API, backend CPU, FFI, partial evaluation, DCE, and staging suites.
- Gate artifact: `artifacts/performance/global_performance_gate.v1.json` maps required phases to existing measured benchmarks and links the `memory` phase to `artifacts/performance/memory_performance_gate.v1.json`, which records Linux procfs RSS evidence for trace, dispatch, AD, vmap, FFT, linalg, cache hit/miss, and durability workloads.
- Optimization queue: `artifacts/performance/optimization_hotspot_scoreboard.v1.json` ranks vmap multiplier, AD tape/backward map, tensor materialization, shape kernels, cache-key hashing, e-graph saturation, FFT/linalg/reduction mixes, and durability encode/decode by measured p95/p99/RSS plus confidence, then creates `br` follow-up beads only for rows scoring at or above `2.0`.
- Policy: p95 regressions above 5% require a risk note; optimization work must baseline, profile, change one lever, prove behavior unchanged, and re-baseline.
- Validation: `crates/fj-conformance/tests/artifact_schemas.rs` includes a coverage test that rejects missing phases, missing benchmark references for measured phases, unmeasured memory rows, synthetic memory numbers, and missing policy flags.

### 2026-05-01: Memory performance gate (`frankenjax-cstq.4`)

- Scope: RSS-gated smoke coverage for trace fingerprinting, JIT dispatch, scalar AD, vector vmap, FFT, Cholesky linalg, cache hit/miss, and durability sidecar recovery.
- Gate artifacts: `artifacts/performance/memory_performance_gate.v1.json`, `artifacts/performance/memory_performance_gate.v1.md`, and `artifacts/e2e/e2e_memory_performance_gate.e2e.json`.
- Durability witness: `artifacts/performance/memory_durability_probe.v1.json` plus `.sidecar.json`, `.scrub.json`, and `.proof.json` prove the durability workload inside the memory gate.
- Validation: `cargo test -p fj-conformance --test memory_performance_gate -- --nocapture`, `./scripts/run_memory_performance_gate.sh --enforce`, and `./scripts/validate_e2e_logs.sh artifacts/e2e/e2e_memory_performance_gate.e2e.json`.

### 2026-05-01: Transform/control-flow matrix gate (`frankenjax-cstq.2`)

- Scope: V1 advanced transform/control-flow behavior matrix for `jit`, `grad`, `vmap`, `value_and_grad`, `jacobian`, `hessian`, nested grad/vmap, `cond`, `scan`, `while`, `switch`, scalar/tensor inputs, multi-carry state, multi-output returns, dtype-mixed rows, and explicit error rows.
- Gate artifacts: `artifacts/conformance/transform_control_flow_matrix.v1.json`, `artifacts/conformance/transform_control_flow_matrix.v1.md`, and `artifacts/e2e/e2e_transform_control_flow_gate.e2e.json`.
- Result: 21 rows pass: 18 supported rows execute under strict mode and 3 unsupported V1 rows fail closed with typed `TransformExecutionError` classes.
- Performance sentinels: `perf_vmap_scan_loop_stack`, `perf_vmap_while_loop_stack`, `perf_jit_vmap_grad_cond`, and `perf_batched_switch` record p50/p95/p99 nanosecond timings plus Linux procfs peak RSS.
- Validation: `cargo test -p fj-conformance --test transform_control_flow_gate -- --nocapture`, `./scripts/run_transform_control_flow_gate.sh --enforce`, and `./scripts/validate_e2e_logs.sh artifacts/e2e/e2e_transform_control_flow_gate.e2e.json`.

### 2026-05-01: Error taxonomy matrix gate (`frankenjax-cstq.8`)

- Scope: cross-crate typed error taxonomy for user-visible strict/hardened boundaries.
- Gate artifacts: `artifacts/conformance/error_taxonomy_matrix.v1.json`, `artifacts/conformance/error_taxonomy_matrix.v1.md`, and `artifacts/e2e/e2e_error_taxonomy_gate.e2e.json`.
- Result: required rows pass for IR validation, transform proof hygiene, primitive arity/type/shape errors, interpreter missing variables, cache unknown-feature policy, vmap axis mismatch, durability missing artifacts, unsupported transform tails, and unsupported transform/control-flow rows.
- Strict/hardened policy: the only allowlisted divergence is cache unknown-feature handling: strict mode rejects unknown incompatible features, while hardened mode preserves them in the deterministic key payload.
- Validation: `cargo test -p fj-conformance --test error_taxonomy_gate -- --nocapture`, `./scripts/run_error_taxonomy_gate.sh --enforce`, and `./scripts/validate_e2e_logs.sh artifacts/e2e/e2e_error_taxonomy_gate.e2e.json`.

### 2026-04-27: `frankenjax-3oq` FFT radix-2 fast path

- Scope: `fj-lax` FFT family (`Fft`, `Ifft`, `Rfft`, `Irfft`) for power-of-two last-axis lengths.
- Baseline: Criterion `eval/*fft_256*` before the change measured `fft=1.1763ms`, `ifft=1.0899ms`, `rfft=1.1658ms`, `irfft=1.0762ms`.
- Profile: `perf record` on the baseline showed `__sincos_fma` as the dominant sample bucket (`74.93%` children, `69.49%` self), under the direct DFT/IDFT loops.
- Opportunity score: impact 5, confidence 5, effort 2 => 12.5.
- Lever: radix-2 Cooley-Tukey path for power-of-two sizes; direct DFT/IDFT remains the exact fallback for non-power-of-two sizes.
- Re-baseline on the same host: `fft=5.7289us` (-99.454%), `ifft=5.7560us` (-99.429%), `rfft=4.0915us` (-99.617%), `irfft=4.7985us` (-99.514%).
- Isomorphism proof: ordering preserved by per-batch in-place butterflies and unchanged output indexing; tie-breaking N/A; RNG N/A; floating-point results are mathematically the same DFT/IDFT with normal floating-point order differences, guarded by direct-reference tests for the fast path and exact fallback tests for non-power-of-two lengths.

### 2026-04-27: `frankenjax-b3xy` batched-index `vmap(switch)` selection

- Scope: `fj-dispatch` BatchTrace handling for primitive-form `Switch` and `Switch` equations carrying sub-Jaxprs when the switch index is batched.
- Baseline: Criterion `vmap_switch/batched_index_128` measured `34.856us` before the change.
- Profile: the source hotspot was the batched-index `Switch` path in `batch_switch_sub_jaxprs`, which sliced every batch element and ran only the selected branch per slice; the benchmark exercises 128 batched indices across identity/add/mul branches.
- Opportunity score: impact 3, confidence 5, effort 2 => 7.5.
- Lever: evaluate each switch branch once with batched inputs, then copy the selected row for each batch index; primitive-form switch values use the same row-selection helper.
- Re-baseline on the same host and target dir: `19.835us` (-44.011%).
- Isomorphism proof: ordering preserved because switch branches are pure Jaxprs and selection still follows the original batch order; tie-breaking/clamping unchanged via the existing `scalar_to_switch_index` rules for negative and high indices; floating-point/RNG N/A for the measured integer branches; golden behavior guarded by primitive and sub-Jaxpr batched switch tests plus conformance `vmap(switch)` coverage.

### 2026-04-28: `frankenjax-fnzr` primitive scalar-sequence `vmap(scan)` folds

- Scope: `fj-dispatch` BatchTrace handling for primitive-form `Scan` when `vmap` maps scalar sequence bodies (`add`, `sub`, `mul`) over batched scalar carries and rank-1/rank-2 `xs`.
- Baseline: Criterion `vmap_scan/shared_init_batched_xs_128x64` measured `313.44us` before the change.
- Profile: the generic transpose-and-vectorized-scan attempt regressed to `462.99us`; the actual source hotspot was the generic per-batch fallback allocating/slicing 128 independent scan executions for a scalar row-fold workload.
- Opportunity score: impact 4, confidence 5, effort 2 => 10.0.
- Lever: fold scalar rows directly from the batched `xs` tensor for supported primitive scan bodies, preserving the existing fallback for higher-rank carries, unsupported body ops, and generalized control-flow scans.
- Re-baseline on the same worker and target dir after narrowing the literal fast path to exact I64/F64 semantics: `35.901us` (-88.546%).
- Isomorphism proof: ordering preserved by iterating scan positions in the same forward/reverse order per batch row; tie-breaking unchanged/N/A; floating-point follows the same left-fold operation order within each row; RNG N/A; behavior guarded by leading-axis, nonzero-axis, scalar-`xs`, and existing dispatch-suite `vmap_scan_batched_carry_and_xs` tests.
