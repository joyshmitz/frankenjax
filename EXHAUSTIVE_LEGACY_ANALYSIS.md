Date: 2026-02-13  
Method stack: `$porting-to-rust` Phase-2 Deep Extraction + `$alien-artifact-coding` + `$extreme-software-optimization` + RaptorQ durability + frankenlibc/frankenfs strict/hardened doctrine.
DOC-PASS-00 baseline matrix: `artifacts/docs/bd-3dl.23.1_gap_matrix.v1.md`

## 0. Mission and Completion Criteria

This document defines exhaustive legacy extraction for FrankenJAX. Phase-2 is complete only when each scoped subsystem has:
1. explicit invariants,
2. explicit crate ownership,
3. explicit oracle families,
4. explicit strict/hardened policy behavior,
5. explicit performance and durability gates.

## 1. Source-of-Truth Crosswalk

Legacy corpus:
- `/data/projects/frankenjax/legacy_jax_code/jax`
- Upstream oracle: `jax-ml/jax`

Project contracts:
- `/data/projects/frankenjax/COMPREHENSIVE_SPEC_FOR_FRANKENJAX_V1.md`
- `/data/projects/frankenjax/EXISTING_JAX_STRUCTURE.md`
- `/data/projects/frankenjax/PLAN_TO_PORT_JAX_TO_RUST.md`
- `/data/projects/frankenjax/PROPOSED_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `/data/projects/frankenjax/FEATURE_PARITY.md`

Important specification gap:
- the comprehensive spec currently defines sections `0-16` (Milestones, Acceptance Gates, Residual Risks); performance budgets and gate topology require empirical calibration and are not yet expressed as numeric thresholds in the spec. Backfill of explicit budget sections is required before release governance is trustworthy.

## 2. Quantitative Legacy Inventory (Measured)

Note: counts below are snapshot approximations from the legacy tree at extraction time and may drift with legacy version updates.

- Total files (excluding .git): `~2000`
- Python: `~1005`
- Native: `cc=~123`, `h=~90`, `c=~2`, `cu=~1`
- Test-like files (matching `*test*`): `~305`

High-density zones:
- `jax/_src/pallas` (69 files)
- `jax/experimental/jax2tf` (61)
- `jax/_src/internal_test_util` (52)
- `jax/experimental/pallas` (50)
- `jax/_src/scipy` (47)

## 3. Subsystem Extraction Matrix (Legacy -> Rust)

| Legacy locus | Non-negotiable behavior to preserve | Target crates | Primary oracles | Phase-2 extraction deliverables |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `jax/_src/core.py` | `Trace`/`Tracer`/`Jaxpr` typing and construction invariants | `fj-core` | `tests/jaxpr_util_test.py`, `tests/jaxpr_effects_test.py` | IR schema and typing law ledger |
| `jax/_src/interpreters/partial_eval.py` | trace-to-jaxpr construction, residual and leak constraints | `fj-interpreters` | `tests/api_test.py`, `tests/extend_test.py` | partial-eval state machine + residual contract |
| `jax/_src/interpreters/{ad,batching,pxla,mlir}.py` | transform composition semantics | `fj-interpreters`, `fj-dispatch` | transform suites in `tests/*` | composition equivalence matrix |
| `jax/_src/api.py` | jit/grad/vmap observable API contracts | `fj-dispatch` | `tests/api_test.py` | API decision table and error-surface map |
| `jax/_src/lax/*` | primitive semantics under transforms | `fj-lax` | `tests/lax_test.py`, `tests/lax_numpy_test.py` | primitive contract corpus |
| `jax/_src/dispatch.py` | runtime token/effect sequencing | `fj-dispatch`, `fj-runtime` | `tests/xla_interpreter_test.py` | effect-token sequencing ledger |
| `jax/_src/compilation_cache.py`, `lru_cache.py` | cache keying and lifecycle determinism | `fj-cache` | `tests/compilation_cache_test.py`, `tests/cache_key_test.py` | cache-key schema + invalidation rules |
| `jax/_src/xla_bridge.py` + `jaxlib/*.cc` | backend selection, FFI bridge correctness | `fj-runtime` | `tests/xla_bridge_test.py` | backend/ffi boundary register |

## 4. Alien-Artifact Invariant Ledger (Formal Obligations)

- `FJ-I1` Jaxpr typing integrity: every produced IR graph remains well-typed under scoped transforms.
- `FJ-I2` Trace leak prohibition: no escaped tracer across transform boundaries.
- `FJ-I3` Composition determinism: scoped transform compositions are order-consistent where contract requires.
- `FJ-I4` Cache key soundness: semantically equivalent inputs map consistently; non-equivalent inputs do not collide silently.
- `FJ-I5` Effect sequencing safety: runtime token ordering preserves observable side-effect semantics.

Required proof artifacts per implemented slice:
1. invariant statement,
2. executable witness fixtures,
3. counterexample archive,
4. remediation proof.

## 5. Native/XLA/FFI Boundary Register

| Boundary | Files | Risk | Mandatory mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| backend bridge | `jax/_src/xla_bridge.py` | critical | backend selection fixture matrix |
| ffi registration/calls | `jax/_src/ffi.py`, `jaxlib/ffi.*` | high | callback lifetime and registration-order tests |
| runtime client/device/program | `jaxlib/py_client*.cc`, `py_device*.cc`, `py_program.cc` | critical | ownership/lifetime stress fixtures |
| host callbacks and transfers | `py_host_callback.cc`, `py_socket_transfer.cc` | high | async transfer and callback race corpus |

## 6. Compatibility and Security Doctrine (Mode-Split)

Decision law (runtime):
`mode + trace_contract + risk_score + budget -> allow | full_validate | fail_closed`

| Threat | Strict mode | Hardened mode | Required ledger artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| malformed trace graph | fail-closed | fail-closed with bounded diagnostics | trace incident ledger |
| cache poisoning/collision risk | strict key checks | include unknown features in canonical hash payload (deterministic differentiation) | cache integrity report |
| backend confusion | fail unknown backend/protocol | fail unknown backend/protocol | backend decision ledger |
| callback lifetime hazard | fail invalid lifecycle state | quarantine and fail with trace | ffi lifecycle report |
| unknown incompatible runtime metadata | fail-closed | accept and include in canonical key material (per `fj-cache` implementation) | compatibility drift report |

Source-anchored foundation artifacts for this doctrine:
- `artifacts/phase2c/FJ-P2C-FOUNDATION/security_threat_matrix.md`
- `artifacts/phase2c/FJ-P2C-FOUNDATION/fail_closed_audit.md`
- `artifacts/phase2c/global/compatibility_matrix.v1.json`
- `artifacts/phase2c/FJ-P2C-FOUNDATION/risk_note.v1.json`

## 7. Conformance Program (Exhaustive First Wave)

### 7.1 Fixture families

1. API transform fixtures (`jit`, `grad`, `vmap`)
2. Jaxpr and effects fixtures
3. primitive/lax numerical fixtures
4. cache key and compilation cache fixtures
5. RNG/state fixtures
6. sharding and multi-device fixtures

### 7.2 Differential harness outputs (`fj-conformance`)

Each run emits:
- machine-readable parity report,
- mismatch class histogram,
- minimized repro fixture bundle,
- strict/hardened divergence report.

Release gate rule: critical-family drift => hard fail.

## 8. Extreme Optimization Program

Primary hotspots:
- trace-to-jaxpr path
- transform composition path
- dispatch/lowering path
- cache lookup and serialization path

Current governance state:
- comprehensive spec sections 14-16 cover milestones, acceptance gates, and residual risks; performance budgets remain provisional and require empirical calibration against first benchmark cycle.

Provisional Phase-2 budgets (must be ratified into spec):
- transform composition overhead regression <= +10%
- cache hit path p95 regression <= +8%
- p99 regression <= +10%, peak RSS regression <= +10%

Optimization governance:
1. baseline,
2. profile,
3. one lever,
4. conformance proof,
5. budget gate,
6. evidence commit.

## 9. RaptorQ-Everywhere Artifact Contract

Durable artifacts requiring RaptorQ sidecars:
- conformance fixture bundles,
- benchmark baselines,
- cache-key schema ledgers,
- risk/proof ledgers.

Required envelope fields:
- source hash,
- symbol manifest,
- scrub status,
- decode proof chain.

## 10. Phase-2 Execution Backlog (Concrete)

1. Extract IR typing rules from `core.py`.
2. Extract partial-eval residual and leak constraints.
3. Extract AD/batching/pxla composition semantics.
4. Extract API argument normalization and error contracts.
5. Extract lax primitive semantic contracts for scoped subset.
6. Extract dispatch token sequencing rules.
7. Extract cache-key schema and lifecycle behavior.
8. Extract backend bridge and FFI lifecycle rules.
9. Build first differential fixture corpus for items 1-8.
10. Implement mismatch taxonomy in `fj-conformance`.
11. Add strict/hardened divergence reporting.
12. Add RaptorQ sidecar generation and decode-proof validation.
13. Ratify section-14-20 budgets/gates against first benchmark and conformance runs.

Definition of done for Phase-2:
- each section-3 row has extraction artifacts,
- all six fixture families runnable,
- governance sections 14-20 are empirically ratified and tied to harness outputs.

## 11. Residual Gaps and Risks

- comprehensive spec sections 14-16 exist (milestones, gates, risks); top non-code risk is uncalibrated budget thresholds until first benchmark cycle lands.
- `PROPOSED_ARCHITECTURE.md` crate map formatting has literal `\n`; normalize before automation.
- backend and FFI boundaries remain highest regression risk until corpus breadth increases.

## 12. Deep-Pass Hotspot Inventory (Measured)

Measured from `/data/projects/frankenjax/legacy_jax_code/jax`:
- file count: `1830`
- concentration: `jax/_src` (`371` files), `jax/experimental` (`214`), plus broad test and backend surfaces

Top source hotspots by line count (first-wave extraction anchors):
1. `tests/pjit_test.py` (`11166`)
2. `jax/_src/numpy/lax_numpy.py` (`9645`)
3. `jax/_src/lax/lax.py` (`9107`)
4. `tests/api_test.py` (`7983`)
5. `tests/lax_numpy_test.py` (`6531`)
6. `jax/_src/pallas/mosaic/lowering.py` (`4460`)

Interpretation:
- JAX behavior is defined jointly by tracing internals and broad test contracts,
- IR/transforms/dispatch/cache boundaries need strict extraction discipline,
- backend and FFI contracts remain highest operational risk.

## 13. Phase-2C Extraction Payload Contract (Per Ticket)

Each `FJ-P2C-*` ticket MUST produce:
1. IR/type/state inventory (jaxpr/tracer/effect structures),
2. transform decision tables (`jit`/`grad`/`vmap` paths),
3. cache and backend routing rule ledger,
4. error and diagnostics contract map,
5. strict/hardened mode split policy,
6. explicit exclusions,
7. fixture mapping manifest,
8. optimization candidate + isomorphism risk note,
9. RaptorQ artifact declaration,
10. compatibility backfill notes for comprehensive-spec governance sections.

Artifact location (normative):
- `artifacts/phase2c/FJ-P2C-00X/legacy_anchor_map.md`
- `artifacts/phase2c/FJ-P2C-00X/contract_table.md`
- `artifacts/phase2c/FJ-P2C-00X/fixture_manifest.json`
- `artifacts/phase2c/FJ-P2C-00X/parity_gate.yaml`
- `artifacts/phase2c/FJ-P2C-00X/risk_note.md`

## 14. Strict/Hardened Compatibility Drift Budgets

Packet acceptance budgets:
- strict critical drift budget: `0`
- strict non-critical drift budget: `<= 0.10%`
- hardened divergence budget: `<= 1.00%` and allowlisted only
- unknown backend/cache/ffi metadata: fail-closed

Per-packet report requirements:
- `strict_parity`,
- `hardened_parity`,
- `transform_drift_summary`,
- `backend_route_drift_summary`,
- `compatibility_drift_hash`.

## 15. Extreme-Software-Optimization Execution Law

Mandatory loop:
1. baseline,
2. profile,
3. one lever,
4. conformance + invariant replay,
5. re-baseline.

Primary sentinel workloads:
- transform composition traces (`FJ-P2C-001..003`),
- dispatch/token sequencing (`FJ-P2C-004`),
- cache-key churn workloads (`FJ-P2C-005`),
- lax primitive throughput tests (`FJ-P2C-008`).

Optimization scoring gate:
`score = (impact * confidence) / effort`, merge only if `score >= 2.0`.

## 16. RaptorQ Evidence Topology and Recovery Drills

Durable artifacts requiring sidecars:
- parity reports,
- transform mismatch corpora,
- backend/cache compatibility ledgers,
- benchmark baselines,
- strict/hardened decision logs.

Naming convention:
- payload: `packet_<id>_<artifact>.json`
- sidecar: `packet_<id>_<artifact>.raptorq.json`
- proof: `packet_<id>_<artifact>.decode_proof.json`

Decode-proof failures are release blockers.

## 17. Phase-2C Exit Checklist (Operational)

Phase-2C is complete only when:
1. `FJ-P2C-001..008` artifact packs exist and pass validation.
2. All packets have strict and hardened fixture coverage.
3. Drift budgets from section 14 are satisfied.
4. High-risk packets include optimization proof artifacts.
5. RaptorQ sidecars + decode proofs are scrub-clean.
6. Governance backfill tasks are explicitly tied to packet outputs.

## 18. Data Model, State, and Invariant Mapping (DOC-PASS-03)

### 18.1 Canonical Data Model Inventory

| Model entity | Primary owner | Core state fields | Non-negotiable invariants | Violation handling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trace graph (`Trace`/`Tracer`/`Jaxpr`) | legacy: `jax/_src/core.py`; Rust: `fj-core` | var ids, equations, in/out vars, transform stack | every referenced var is defined; outputs do not shadow prior vars; canonical fingerprint determinism | strict: fail-closed with typed error; hardened: emit ledger event + bounded recovery only where contract allows |
| Transform composition proof (`jit`/`grad`/`vmap`) | legacy: interpreter stack; Rust: `fj-core` + `fj-dispatch` | ordered transform vector, per-transform evidence | supported sequence only; evidence count equals transform count; composition signature stable | strict: reject unsupported composition; hardened: allow only documented bounded fallback and log divergence |
| Cache identity (`cache_key`) | legacy: `cache_key.py`; Rust: `fj-cache` | backend id/version, compile options, flags, accelerator config, hooks | semantically equivalent inputs hash consistently; unknown incompatible metadata is not silently accepted in strict mode | strict: fail-closed on unknown incompatible metadata; hardened: explicit compatibility event + allowlisted continuation |
| Dispatch request/response envelope | legacy: `dispatch.py`; Rust: `fj-dispatch` | mode, backend, transforms, args, options, unknown feature list | transform order preserved; request immutability during execution; response deterministic for deterministic inputs | strict: surface deterministic error; hardened: bounded fallback paths with audit signal |
| Evidence/decision ledger | legacy analog spread across runtime policies; Rust: `fj-ledger` | evidence signals, posterior, loss matrix, action record | append-only ordering; calibrated posterior computation; decision traceability | strict/hardened: never drop records; always emit deterministic decision metadata |
| Durability sidecar artifacts | legacy N/A (new contract); Rust: `fj-conformance::durability` | symbol manifest, source hash, scrub/proof reports | scrub hash equals source hash; decode proof succeeds for configured symbol loss | strict/hardened: decode-proof failure is release blocker (no silent bypass) |

### 18.2 Critical State Transitions

| Subsystem | States | Valid transitions | Invalid transition example | Required recovery/audit output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trace/Jaxpr construction | `Init -> CollectEq -> SealOutvars -> Fingerprint` | monotonic equation append, then seal, then fingerprint | fingerprint before outvar seal | emit invariant failure with offending var/equation and stop in strict mode |
| Transform execution stack | `Request -> Verify -> Apply(jit/grad/vmap)* -> Eval -> Return` | each transform consumes one stack entry in declared order | skipping verify and executing transforms directly | write transform-order incident to ledger; fail closed in strict mode |
| Cache lifecycle | `CanonicalizeInput -> Hash -> Lookup -> Hit|Miss -> (Compile -> Write)` | read-before-write and deterministic key generation | write cache entry without canonical key | cache-integrity incident + block write path |
| Runtime admission | `CollectEvidence -> PosteriorEstimate -> RecommendAction -> Keep|Kill|Reprofile` | decision derived from current posterior and loss matrix | emitting action without posterior/evidence update | log policy inconsistency and deny unsafe action |
| Durability pipeline | `GenerateSidecar -> Scrub -> DecodeProof -> Gate` | scrub and proof must bind to same artifact hash | proof generated against stale sidecar | mark artifact invalid and block release path |

### 18.3 Invariant Violation and Recovery Semantics

| Invariant band | Detector | Strict mode behavior | Hardened mode behavior | Evidence artifact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trace/Jaxpr shape or var integrity | IR validator + interpreter checks | immediate fail-closed | bounded diagnostic + fail-closed unless explicitly allowlisted | parity report + risk note |
| Transform composition mismatch | composition proof verifier | reject request | bounded fallback only if contractually defined; always log | transform drift summary |
| Cache metadata incompatibility | cache-key compatibility gate | reject key generation | allow only audited compatibility path with explicit event | compatibility matrix row + ledger event |
| Dispatch/order anomaly | dispatch invariant checks | stop execution | stop or bounded fallback with mandatory audit trace | decision/evidence ledger |
| Artifact durability mismatch | scrub/proof verifier | block release | block release | sidecar/scrub/decode-proof triplet |

## 19. Execution-Path Tracing and Control-Flow Narratives (DOC-PASS-04)

### 19.1 End-to-End Path E1: Request -> Trace -> Transform -> Runtime

Nominal path:

1. API layer receives transformed program intent (`jit`/`grad`/`vmap` family).
2. Trace/Jaxpr model is built and normalized into canonical IR.
3. Transform composition proof is validated before execution.
4. Compatibility-gated cache key is derived.
5. Dispatch applies transform wrappers in stack order.
6. Interpreter evaluates residual IR path and returns outputs.
7. Evidence ledger and runtime admission model emit decision metadata.

Mandatory branch handling:

| Branch | Trigger | Strict mode | Hardened mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| transform-order branch | unsupported sequence / evidence count mismatch | fail-closed before execution | bounded fallback only if contract allows + audit record |
| cache-compat branch | unknown incompatible metadata | fail-closed key path | compatibility event + bounded continuation |
| interpreter-integrity branch | malformed var/shape/graph refs | deterministic error and stop | deterministic error and stop (with additional diagnostics) |
| policy branch | low-confidence admission posterior | choose conservative action (`Kill`/`Reprofile`) | same action with richer policy trace |

### 19.2 End-to-End Path E2: Cache Hit/Miss and Compilation Decisioning

1. Canonical key material assembled.
2. Lookup branch:
   - hit: short-circuit execution path.
   - miss: full evaluation/compile path.
3. Miss branch completes with guarded cache write.

Safety-critical side branches:
- stale/corrupt cache read -> bypass and record integrity incident.
- unstable/untrusted key input -> refuse write to persistent cache.
- backend mismatch -> fail-closed (no speculative reroute).

### 19.3 End-to-End Path E3: Differential Conformance Pipeline

1. Fixture corpus loaded by family and mode.
2. Cases executed through dispatch path.
3. Comparator branch classifies output (`exact`/`approx`/`shape`/`type`).
4. Drift report emitted with strict/hardened split.
5. Failure branch emits replayable forensic bundle.

Non-negotiable branch law:
- comparator mismatch may never be downgraded silently,
- strict critical drift budget remains zero,
- hardened divergence must be allowlisted and auditable.

### 19.4 End-to-End Path E4: Durability Scrub/Proof Gate

1. Generate sidecar repair symbols.
2. Scrub integrity against source hash.
3. Execute decode proof under configured symbol loss.
4. Gate release on pass/pass outcome.

Failure choreography:
- scrub mismatch -> invalidate artifact, block release.
- decode-proof failure -> block release and require regenerated evidence.
- stale sidecar/proof pairing -> fail-closed until artifact tuple is re-bound.

### 19.5 Verification Crosswalk

Execution-path sections in this document are explicitly tied to:
- `bd-3dl.12.5` (unit/property + logging coverage),
- `bd-3dl.12.6` (differential/metamorphic/adversarial checks),
- `bd-3dl.12.7` (E2E replay/forensics),
- `bd-3dl.23.10` (docs-to-test/logging crosswalk),
- `bd-3dl.23.11` and `bd-3dl.23.12` (integrated draft passes).

## 20. Complexity, Performance, and Memory Characterization (DOC-PASS-05)

### 20.1 Legacy Algorithmic Complexity Classes

| Legacy subsystem | Primary function | Complexity class | Key dimension | Code anchor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jaxpr evaluation | `core.py:eval_jaxpr` | O(E) | E = equations | `jax/_src/core.py:729-754` |
| Dead variable cleanup | `core.py:clean_up_dead_vars` | O(k) per equation | k = dead vars per step | `jax/_src/core.py:4002-4008` |
| Last-used analysis | `core.py:last_used` | O(E * K) | K = avg equation arity | `jax/_src/core.py:3992-4000` |
| Tracer leak detection | `core.py` gc scan | O(heap) | gc-reachable objects | `jax/_src/core.py:1495-1569` |
| Partial-eval trace | `partial_eval.py:trace_to_jaxpr` | O(ops) | ops = traced operations | `jax/_src/interpreters/partial_eval.py:525-596` |
| Partial-eval call split | `partial_eval.py:process_call` | O(n * m) | n = inputs, m = nesting | `jax/_src/interpreters/partial_eval.py:216-270` |
| Dead code elimination | `partial_eval.py:dce_jaxpr` | O(E * K) | E = equations, K = outputs | `jax/_src/interpreters/partial_eval.py:1411-1510` |

| Cache executable I/O | `compilation_cache.py` get/put | O(X) | X = executable size | `jax/_src/compilation_cache.py:276-351` |
| IR tree walk | `compiler.py:_walk_operations` | O(N) | N = IR nodes | `jax/_src/compiler.py:80-90` |
| Dispatch primitive | `dispatch.py:apply_primitive` | O(1) cached | per-primitive cache | `jax/_src/dispatch.py:84-94` |

### 20.2 Legacy Memory Growth Patterns

| Growth driver | Component | Growth formula | Peak trigger | Mitigation in legacy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tracer accumulation | `partial_eval.py`, `core.py` | O(T) where T = total tracers | complex nested traces | dead variable cleanup during eval |
| Residual forwarding | `partial_eval.py:process_call` | O(R * D) where R = residuals, D = call nesting depth | nested transform compositions | substitution-list forwarding optimization |
| AD dual jaxprs | `ad.py:linearize_jaxpr` | O(E) primal + O(E) tangent | large programs under `grad` | `@weakref_lru_cache` on linearization result |
| Cache key serialization | `cache_key.py:get` | O(S) full IR serialization | large MLIR modules | conditional canonicalization via config flag |
| CompileOptions deepcopy | `cache_key.py:281` | O(C) per cache lookup | frequent cache miss paths | none (known cost accepted) |
| Compilation cache entries | `compilation_cache.py` | O(M * X_avg) where M = max_size | many distinct compilations | LRU eviction with configurable max_size |
| Executable deserialization | `compilation_cache.py:290-294` | O(X) per cache hit | large compiled executables | zstandard/zlib compression |

### 20.3 Legacy Hotspot Families

**Family H1: Trace-to-IR construction path**
- Location: `core.py:eval_jaxpr`, `partial_eval.py:trace_to_jaxpr`, `partial_eval.py:process_call`
- Pattern: sequential equation processing with environment management
- Dominant cost: linear in program size, but residual forwarding in nested calls can compound to O(n^2) through substitution-list chaining
- Memory peak: all tracers stored until jaxpr conversion

**Family H2: Cache key computation path**
- Location: `cache_key.py:get`, `cache_key.py:_hash_serialized_compile_options`, `cache_key.py:_canonicalize_ir`
- Pattern: full IR serialization + deep copy of compile options + tree walk for callback removal
- Dominant cost: O(S) where S = serialized IR module size; deepcopy adds constant-factor overhead
- Memory peak: cloned MLIR module + deepcopied CompileOptions held simultaneously

**Family H3: Transform composition path**
- Location: `ad.py:linearize_jaxpr`, `batching.py:process_primitive`, `partial_eval.py:process_map`
- Pattern: each transform layer wraps/rewrites the program representation
- Dominant cost: multiplicative with transform stack depth (grad adds backward pass, vmap adds per-slice iteration)
- Memory peak: dual jaxpr (primal + tangent) under grad, plus residual lists

**Family H4: DCE and post-trace optimization**
- Location: `partial_eval.py:dce_jaxpr`
- Pattern: reverse pass through equations checking output liveness
- Dominant cost: O(E * K) reverse traversal
- Memory peak: filtered equation lists and used-variable sets

**Family H5: Compilation and executable cache I/O**
- Location: `compilation_cache.py:get_executable_and_time`, `compilation_cache.py:put_executable_and_time`
- Pattern: serialization/deserialization + compression/decompression of compiled executables
- Dominant cost: O(X) where X = executable size; compression adds constant factor
- Memory peak: compressed + decompressed forms held during transition

### 20.4 Complexity Scaling Laws (Legacy)

Transform composition multiplies base evaluation cost:
- `jit` alone: 1x base trace + compilation
- `grad(f)`: 2x base (forward pass + backward pass), plus residual memory
- `vmap(f)`: L x base where L = leading dimension
- `vmap(grad(f))`: L x 2x base (each vmap slice runs full grad)
- Nested `jit(grad(f))`: cache miss = trace + grad + compile; cache hit = O(1) dispatch

### 20.5 Performance Budget Anchors (From Section 8)

Provisional budgets from section 8 (pending empirical calibration):
- transform composition overhead regression: <= +10%
- cache hit path p95 regression: <= +8%
- p99 regression: <= +10%
- peak RSS regression: <= +10%

These budgets apply to the Rust implementation relative to equivalent legacy workload classes and must be validated against hotspot families H1-H5 above.

## 21. Concurrency, Lifecycle Semantics, and Ordering Guarantees (DOC-PASS-06)

### 21.1 Legacy Threading Architecture

Legacy JAX uses thread-local state as its primary concurrency mechanism. Trace state, JIT compilation context, and runtime token ordering are all bound to thread-local storage.

| Mechanism | Location | Purpose | Thread-safety model |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TracingContext(threading.local)` | `jax/_src/core.py:1303-1346` | trace state per thread | thread-local isolation; no cross-thread sharing |
| `_initialize_jax_jit_thread_local_state` | `jax/_src/core.py:1446-1478` | C++ JIT state init callback | spawned threads start with None state; explicit init required |
| `RuntimeTokenSet(threading.local)` | `jax/_src/dispatch.py:118-150` | ordered effect token management | per-thread token dicts; device ordering may vary across threads |
| `_backend_lock = threading.Lock()` | `jax/_src/xla_bridge.py:265` | backend registration guard | mutex protects global backend registry |
| `_plugin_lock = threading.Lock()` | `jax/_src/xla_bridge.py:267` | plugin initialization guard | mutex protects plugin init |
| `_cache_initialized_mutex` | `jax/_src/compilation_cache.py:60` | compilation cache init guard | double-checked locking pattern (lines 75-80) |

### 21.2 Trace Lifecycle Ordering

Legacy trace lifecycle is strictly sequential within a thread:

1. `trace_state` initialized (thread-local).
2. Trace context pushed via `TracingContext`.
3. Equations appended in execution order.
4. Trace finalized by converting to Jaxpr.
5. `reset_trace_state()` cleans up with `trace_state_clean()` check (`core.py:1460-1463`).

Non-negotiable ordering: equation append order equals execution order; reordering is not semantics-preserving.

### 21.3 Effect Token Ordering

Runtime effect ordering (`dispatch.py:118-150`) uses per-device token dicts. The legacy code acknowledges ordering fragility:
- Comment at line 140-142: "The order of devices may change... This might still be buggy in a multi-process SPMD scenario."
- Token assignment order equals device enumeration order, not user-specified order.

### 21.4 Cache Concurrency and Memoization

Legacy uses `@cache()`, `@weakref_lru_cache`, and `@functools.lru_cache` extensively across core modules (`core.py:1756, 2145, 2173, 2341, 3165`). These caches are:
- Thread-safe by default (CPython GIL provides implicit synchronization for dict operations).
- Not explicitly designed for multi-threaded contention (no fine-grained locking on cache read/write paths beyond the compilation cache mutex).

### 21.5 Fork Incompatibility

Legacy JAX explicitly warns about fork safety (`xla_bridge.py:150-154`):
- `os.fork()` is incompatible with JAX's multithreaded runtime and will likely deadlock.
- `_at_fork()` handler detects fork usage and issues warning.
- FrankenJAX can inherit this constraint or choose to enforce fail-closed on fork detection.

### 21.6 Porting Implications

FrankenJAX current Rust execution is single-threaded by design (`EXISTING_JAX_STRUCTURE.md` section 14). If parallelism is introduced:
- Trace state must remain thread-isolated (no shared mutable trace frames).
- Effect token ordering must be made explicit and deterministic.
- Cache paths must use explicit synchronization (not GIL-equivalent).
- Fork detection should be fail-closed in both strict and hardened modes.

## 22. Error Taxonomy, Failure Modes, and Recovery Semantics (DOC-PASS-07)

### 22.1 Legacy Error Class Hierarchy

| Error class | Base | Location | Trigger domain |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_JAXErrorMixin` | (mixin) | `jax/_src/errors.py:22-33` | base mixin providing error page links |
| `JAXTypeError` | `TypeError` | `jax/_src/errors.py:37` | type-level violations in JAX context |
| `JAXIndexError` | `IndexError` | `jax/_src/errors.py:42` | index-level violations |
| `ConcretizationTypeError` | `JAXTypeError` | `jax/_src/errors.py:47-130` | tracer vs concrete value conflicts (extensive docs) |
| `NonConcreteBooleanIndexError` | `JAXIndexError` | `jax/_src/errors.py:138` | boolean masking in JIT contexts |
| `TracerArrayConversionError` | `JAXTypeError` | `jax/_src/errors.py:230` | array conversion from tracers |
| `TracerIntegerConversionError` | `JAXTypeError` | `jax/_src/errors.py:318` | integer conversion from tracers |
| `TracerBoolConversionError` | `ConcretizationTypeError` | `jax/_src/errors.py:414` | boolean conversion from tracers |
| `UnexpectedTracerError` | `JAXTypeError` | `jax/_src/errors.py:526` | tracer leaked outside transform scope |
| `KeyReuseError` | `JAXTypeError` | `jax/_src/errors.py:661` | PRNG key reuse detection |
| `JaxprTypeError` | `TypeError` | `jax/_src/core.py:3240` | Jaxpr well-formedness validation |
| `ShardingTypeError` | `Exception` | `jax/_src/core.py:2038` | sharding inconsistency |
| `SpecMatchError` | `Exception` | `jax/_src/interpreters/batching.py:791` | batch spec mismatches |
| `TypePromotionError` | `ValueError` | `jax/_src/dtypes.py:725` | dtype promotion conflicts |
| `JaxValueError` | `ValueError` | `jax/_src/error_check.py:42` | runtime value checks |

### 22.2 Jaxpr Validation Error Surface

The `JaxprTypeError` in `core.py:3247-3428` covers comprehensive IR validation:
- Variable binding violations (lines 3313, 3334): duplicate or unbound vars.
- Call primitive parameter mismatches (lines 3466, 3475): incorrect call_jaxpr params.
- Map primitive parameter validation (lines 3494-3510): axis/in_axes shape checks.
- Effect consistency checks (lines 3394-3414): effect set mismatch between jaxpr declaration and equation effects.

### 22.3 Legacy Failure Modes

| Failure mode | Error type | Recovery | User visibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tracer escapes transform scope | `UnexpectedTracerError` | none; program terminates | direct error with scope context |
| Concrete value required in JIT | `ConcretizationTypeError` | restructure code to avoid data-dependent control flow | direct error with detailed guidance |
| AD rule not implemented | `NotImplementedError` (`ad.py:324-326`) | none for that primitive | blocks gradient computation |
| Batch spec mismatch | `SpecMatchError` | fix input shapes/axes | blocks vmap execution |
| Jaxpr validation failure | `JaxprTypeError` | fix program construction | blocks lowering/execution |
| PRNG key reused | `KeyReuseError` | use `jax.random.split` | direct warning/error |

### 22.4 Legacy-to-Rust Error Correspondence

| Legacy error | Rust equivalent | Parity status |
|---|---|---|
| `JaxprTypeError` | `fj-core::JaxprValidationError` | covered (binding, arity, shape checks) |
| `ConcretizationTypeError` | not applicable (no tracer-level concretization yet) | deferred |
| `UnexpectedTracerError` | not applicable (no tracer leak detection yet) | deferred |
| AD `NotImplementedError` | `fj-ad::AdError` | partially covered (scalar constraints) |
| `SpecMatchError` (batching) | `fj-dispatch::TransformExecutionError` | covered (vmap shape checks) |
| cache key incompatibility | `fj-cache::CacheKeyError::UnknownIncompatibleFeatures` | covered (strict mode) |

## 23. Security and Compatibility Edge Cases (DOC-PASS-08)

### 23.1 Legacy Undefined Behavior Zones

| Zone | Location | Description | Risk level |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tracer const assertion disabled | `core.py:265` | TODO: "assert not any(isinstance(c, Tracer) for c in consts)" — validation bypassed | medium; const contamination possible |
| Jaxpr context hack | `core.py:317, 351` | TODO: "remove this hack when we add contexts to jaxpr" | medium; jaxpr metadata incomplete |
| JIT disable path | `dispatch.py:87-93` | TODO about primitive application when JIT disabled | low; debug path only |
| Multi-process SPMD token ordering | `dispatch.py:140-142` | "This might still be buggy in a multi-process SPMD scenario" | high; ordering corruption possible |
| AD pmap with out_axes=None | `ad.py:1268` | "autodiff of pmap functions with out_axes=None is not supported" | medium; silent failure possible |
| Tracer leak false positives | `core.py:1472-1492` | `TRACER_LEAK_DEBUGGER_WARNING` — leak detection produces false positives under debuggers | low; diagnostic only |
| Partial-eval constant pruning | `partial_eval.py:149` | "Think twice before changing this constant argument pruning!" — fragile optimization | medium; behavioral change risk |

### 23.2 Legacy Compatibility-Sensitive Surfaces

| Surface | Risk | Legacy handling |
|---|---|---|
| Cache key with unknown metadata | cache confusion | no explicit fail-closed; metadata silently included in hash |
| Transform composition ordering | semantic drift | verified but only for documented compositions |
| Backend version drift | compilation mismatch | backend version included in cache key material |
| Plugin registration order | undefined execution order | mutex-guarded but order-dependent |
| Fork after JAX init | deadlock | warning issued but not fail-closed |

### 23.3 FrankenJAX Strict/Hardened Posture for Legacy Edge Cases

FrankenJAX strengthens the legacy posture at each edge case:
- Unknown cache metadata: strict fail-closed (vs legacy silent inclusion).
- Transform ordering: explicit composition proof required before execution.
- Fork detection: can choose fail-closed in strict mode.
- Tracer const validation: can enable the assertion that legacy bypasses.
- AD undefined primitives: explicit `EvalError::Unsupported` instead of `NotImplementedError`.

## 24. Unit/E2E Test Corpus and Logging Evidence Crosswalk (DOC-PASS-09)

### 24.1 Legacy Test Corpus Inventory

Total test files: 155+ in `tests/` directory.

| Test file | Lines | Approx test count | Coverage domain |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tests/pjit_test.py` | 11,166 | ~180 | partitioned JIT |
| `tests/api_test.py` | 7,983 | ~515 | core API (jit, grad, vmap) |
| `tests/lax_numpy_test.py` | 6,531 | ~200 | NumPy compatibility |
| `tests/shard_map_test.py` | 5,626 | ~150 | sharding operations |
| `tests/lax_test.py` | 5,433 | ~300 | LAX primitive operations |
| `tests/custom_api_test.py` | 4,922 | ~227 | custom primitives and transforms |
| `tests/batching_test.py` | 2,300+ | ~4 (parameterized) | vectorization/vmap |
| `tests/core_test.py` | 1,800+ | ~33 | core tracing and Jaxpr validation |
| `tests/jaxpr_effects_test.py` | 1,139 | ~50 | effects system and ordering |

### 24.2 Legacy Test Organization Patterns

Tests use `absltest` framework with:
- `jtu.request_cpu_devices(N)` for multi-device setup.
- Parameterized test methods via `@jtu.sample_product`.
- Threading-aware test setup (`import threading` in api_test.py:36).
- Custom effect classes for isolated testing (`jaxpr_effects_test.py:49-74`).

Subdirectory specialization:
- `tests/config/` — configuration tests.
- `tests/mosaic/` — GPU-specific Pallas/Mosaic tests (11+ files).

### 24.3 Legacy-to-FrankenJAX Test Mapping

| Legacy oracle family | Legacy anchor | FrankenJAX anchor | Coverage status |
|---|---|---|---|
| API transform contracts | `tests/api_test.py` | `fj-dispatch` + `fj-conformance/tests/e2e.rs` | partial (jit/grad/vmap covered) |
| Jaxpr construction/validation | `tests/core_test.py`, `tests/jaxpr_effects_test.py` | `fj-core` + `fj-conformance/tests/ir_core_oracle.rs` | strong (validation suite present) |
| Primitive semantics | `tests/lax_test.py` | `fj-lax` inline tests + `fj-conformance/tests/transforms.rs` | partial (25+ primitives covered; shape ops new) |
| AD correctness | `tests/lax_autodiff_test.py` | `fj-ad` inline tests | partial (scalar grad covered) |
| Batching semantics | `tests/batching_test.py` | `fj-dispatch` vmap tests | partial (leading-axis vmap covered) |
| Cache behavior | `tests/compilation_cache_test.py`, `tests/cache_key_test.py` | `fj-cache` + `fj-dispatch` strict mode tests | partial (key derivation covered; lifecycle gap) |
| Partial eval/staging | `tests/api_test.py` (staging portions) | `fj-conformance/tests/pe_staging_oracle.rs`, `fj-conformance/tests/e2e_p2c003.rs` | strong (roundtrip + metamorphic) |

### 24.4 Coverage Gaps (Legacy Oracle)

| Priority | Gap | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | No FrankenJAX test parity for legacy `api_test.py` ~515 tests | transform API behavior coverage incomplete |
| P0 | No FrankenJAX test parity for `lax_test.py` ~300 tests | primitive coverage relies on inline tests only |
| P1 | No effect system test equivalent (no effects model in Rust yet) | effects ordering untested |
| P1 | Multi-device test infrastructure missing | single-device only |
| P2 | NumPy compatibility layer (`lax_numpy_test.py`) entirely deferred | out of scope for V1 |

## 25. Pass-B Closure Crosswalk (DOC-PASS-11)

### 25.1 Section Coverage Mapping

| DOC-PASS objective | Section in this document | Content type |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy complexity characterization | 20 (DOC-PASS-05) | complexity tables, memory growth, hotspot families |
| Concurrency/lifecycle semantics | 21 (DOC-PASS-06) | threading architecture, trace lifecycle, fork incompatibility |
| Error taxonomy and failure modes | 22 (DOC-PASS-07) | error hierarchy, failure modes, legacy-to-Rust correspondence |
| Security/compatibility edge cases | 23 (DOC-PASS-08) | undefined zones, compatibility surfaces, hardened posture |
| Test corpus and logging crosswalk | 24 (DOC-PASS-09) | legacy test inventory, coverage mapping, priority gaps |
| Data model and invariant mapping | 18 (DOC-PASS-03) | canonical data model, state transitions, violation semantics |
| Execution-path narratives | 19 (DOC-PASS-04) | end-to-end workflows with branch handling |

### 25.2 Expansion Completeness Assessment

Pass-B expansion adds sections 20-25, bringing total DOC-PASS-integrated content to 8 sections (18-25). Combined with the original sections 0-17, the document now covers:
- Quantitative legacy inventory and subsystem extraction (sections 0-12).
- Phase-2C contracts, budgets, and governance (sections 13-17).
- Deep behavior analysis: data model, execution paths, complexity, concurrency, errors, security, testing (sections 18-24).
- Closure crosswalk and confidence annotations (sections 25-26).

### 25.3 Remaining Gaps for Pass-C

- No legacy profiling data (empirical benchmarks not yet collected).
- No formal proof artifacts for invariant obligations (section 4 obligations remain contractual).
- Effect system documentation deferred (no effects model in Rust yet).
- Multi-device/distributed semantics deferred (out of V1 scope).

## 26. Section-Level Confidence Annotations (DOC-PASS-14)

Confidence scale:
- `High`: directly validated against repository sources with low interpretation risk.
- `Medium-High`: source-anchored synthesis with limited inference.
- `Medium`: source-anchored but sensitive to fixture churn or implementation changes.

| `12. Deep-Pass Hotspot Inventory` | `High` | measured from legacy tree | legacy snapshot update |
| `13. Phase-2C Extraction Payload Contract` | `High` | stable contract template | ticket format changes |
| `14. Strict/Hardened Compatibility Drift Budgets` | `Medium` | budgets defined but uncalibrated | empirical calibration |
| `15. Extreme-Software-Optimization Execution Law` | `Medium-High` | governance loop defined; sentinel workloads pending | workload availability |
| `16. RaptorQ Evidence Topology` | `High` | naming and failure choreography implemented | schema revision |
| `17. Phase-2C Exit Checklist` | `Medium-High` | checklist reflects current exit criteria | criteria revision |
| `18. Data Model, State, and Invariant Mapping` | `Medium-High` | source-anchored across legacy and Rust | IR/runtime model expansion |
| `19. Execution-Path Tracing and Control-Flow Narratives` | `Medium` | narratives depend on evolving orchestration | dispatch/runtime flow rewrites |
| `20. Complexity, Performance, and Memory Characterization` | `Medium-High` | complexity classes from code-level analysis | algorithm changes or new hotspots |
| `21. Concurrency/Lifecycle Semantics` | `Medium-High` | anchored to concrete threading primitives | parallelism introduction |
| `22. Error Taxonomy, Failure Modes, and Recovery` | `Medium-High` | error classes anchored to source definitions | new error domains |

| `24. Unit/E2E Test Corpus Crosswalk` | `Medium` | mapped to current test corpus, actively growing | new tests or renamed scenarios |
| `25. Pass-B Closure Crosswalk` | `Medium-High` | internally consistent with all preceding sections | future pass additions |

Pass-B expansion note:
- This confidence table should be refreshed when bead `bd-3dl.23.14` (final consistency/sign-off) runs.
- Sections marked `Medium` are highest priority for revalidation during Pass-C deep dive.
